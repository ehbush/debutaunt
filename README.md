# debutaunt
## Also Known As
**Debian Update Tool &amp; APT Unified Terminal**

## What is it?
Debutaunt is a bash script created to make debian-based updates & upgrades quicker. I have a home lab that contains: ~10 Raspberry Pi, ~10 Virtual Machines, ~4 Mini-PC's running different Debian-flavours, ~3 remote Linux servers, and am adding more constantly. As a result, I found that I was spending quite a bit of time to perform updates & upgrades; while there are other solutions to this problem, I wanted to build my own script, catered to my own needs and intended for my own personal use. 

### What were the requirements of the script? 
**The requirements I set out for myself were:**
* Create a Bash Script that performs the update & upgrades I perform most frequently
* Ensure the script will work on all flavours of Debian-based distros that I run in my home lab
* Add a dietpi flag to the script for my many dietpi based Pi's
* Allow the script to accept user-input at run-time
* Host it in GitHub for the many reasons that GitHub is awesome. Tracking changes, allow others to fork/contribute/criticise :), + GitHub being an easy place to pull from on fresh Linux installs (virtual machines/Pi's, etc.).
